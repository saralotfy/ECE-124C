                <p style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bolder;">- It’s easy to get confused when it comes to health and nutrition.
                    Even qualified experts often seem to hold opposing opinions.  
                    Yet, despite all the disagreements, a number of wellness tips are well supported by research.<br>  
                    Here are some health and nutrition tips that are actually based on good science.</p>
                <h3 class="tip-adress">1-Eat at least three meals every day.</h3>
                <p class="tips"> Eating at least three meals each day is important 
                    for healthy eating. Eating at regular times throughout the day helps people eat the right
                     amount of food that they need for energy. Regular mealtimes also make it easier to get
                    enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from each of the four food groups: 
                    Vegetables and Fruit, Grain Products, Milk and Alternatives, and Meat and Alternatives.</p>
                    <h3 class="tip-adress">2-Limit sweets and sugar-sweetened beverages.</h3>
                <p class="tips">Soft drinks, fruit-flavoured drinks, sports and energy drinks, 
                    and other sweetened beverages are high in sugar, low in nutrition, can add 
                    a significant number of calories to your daily intake, and can lead to heart
                     disease and diabetes. </p>
                <h3 class="tip-adress">3-Choose fish, poultry, beans and nuts more often.</h3>
                <p class="tips">The emphasis should be on small, lean portions of meat or poultry, 
                    and fish. Try to use meat alternatives such as pulses (dried beans and lentils) 
                    and tofu more often. The benefit of these foods over meats is that they are low 
                    in saturated fat and, in the case of pulses, are also very high in fibre. Eggs and 
                    nuts are also found in this food group, because they are excellent sources of protein 
                    and other nutrients. Seventy-five grams (2-½ ounces) is considered one serving and is 
                    appropriate for a meal. This is about the size of a deck of cards or the palm of your hand.</p>
                <h3 class="tip-adress">4-Eat more vegetables, fruits and whole grains.</h3>
                <p class="tips">Most vegetables and fruits are naturally low in fat and calories,
                     and high in important nutrients such as vitamins A and C, potassium and fibre. 
                     Enjoy at least one dark green and one orange vegetable every day.</p>
                 <h3 class="tip-adress" >5-Include fat-free or low-fat dairy products.</h3> 
                 <p class="tips" >Milk or a fortified alternative beverage such as a soy beverage is 
                     an important way to get protein, calcium, vitamin D, and many other vitamins and 
                     minerals. Choose low fat milk, such as skim or 1% milk fat (M.F.)</p> 
                <h3 class="tip-adress">6-Limit foods that are high in saturated fat.</h3>
                <p class="tips">Fat is naturally present in many foods, including meat, fish, cheese and nuts. 
                    Most of the fat in meat and dairy products is saturated fat. Butter is also a major source 
                    of saturated fat. Aim to include a small amount of unsaturated fat each day (two to three 
                    tablespoons). This includes vegetable oils, salad dressings, soft margarine and nuts.</p>

                should be consuming on average. Food groups are listed out on the left of the chart, 
                and we list the average amount adult men and women should eat in a day as well as what a 
                serving size of that food group is and what it might look like to see such a serving. </p>
