                Healthy eating means eating a variety of foods that give you the nutrients 
                you need to maintain your health, feel good, and have energy. These nutrients
                include protein, carbohydrates, fat, water, vitamins, and minerals.
                Nutrition is important for everyone.
                When combined with being physically active and maintaining a healthy weight, 
                eating well is an excellent way to help your body stay strong and healthy. 
                If you have a history of breast cancer or are currently undergoing treatment, 
                eating well is especially important for you. What you eat can affect your immune system,
                your mood, and your energy level.</p><br>

                Health food is a marketing term to suggest human health effects beyond
                a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. Foods marketed as health foods
                may be part of one or more categories, such as natural foods, organic foods,
                whole foods, vegetarian foods or dietary supplements.These products may be sold 
                in health food stores or in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores.
                While there is no precise definition for "health food", the United States Food
                and Drug Administration monitors and warns food manufacturers against labeling foods 
                as having specific health effects when no evidence exists to support such statements.

                to help you have a healthy life.we will also introduce many tips related to

            <h2 style="padding-left: 20px;">A balanced diet is the best way to stay healthy</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px;">A balanced diet is about adding all of 
                the essential factors necessary for growth, so that every part of the body gets what 
                it needs to function properly. A balanced diet is also indicative of a proportioned diet.
                 This means that you’re not only eating the right food items, you’re also eating them 
                 in the proper amounts. Adopting a balanced diet not only boosts your health, but also
                  helps with weight loss.</p>

  <h2>1-Carbohydrates</h2>
  <p class="cont">An excellent source of energy, carbohydrates should comprise roughly 60% of a person’s diet or 
      310 grams. This is where most of your energy comes from if you’re engaged in activity throughout 
      the day; eat lots of carb-rich food items such as rice, pasta, potatoes, and wheat.</p>
  <h2>2-Vitamins</h2>
  <p class="cont">There are so many essential vitamins today, but pay particular attention to the intake of the following:
    vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B, and vitamin D. Taking multivitamins for these four is ideal although 
     obtaining them from fruits and vegetables is even better.</p>
  <h2>3-Minerals</h2>
  <p class="cont">Minerals aid with the release of energy from food items, plus they interact with the organs
       to promote growth. For example, iron helps with energy, while calcium works towards bone and teeth 
       development. Again, there are lots of minerals today, but the most important ones in your diet are: 
       iodine, potassium, sodium, and those mentioned above.</p>
  <h2>4-Unsaturated Fats</h2>
  <p class="cont">A lot of people avoid fat thinking that they cause weight gain, but this is far from the truth. 
      Healthy fats, or those derived from good sources are dairy products, meat, and fish. Their main 
      function is to help regulate body temperature, as well as the absorption of vitamins. They help with 
      slow energy release, which is perfect for long-distance runners. Consume around 70 grams per day.</p>
